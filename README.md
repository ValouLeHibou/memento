Final Project

## Descovering the Solid technologie

The begenning was ... Complecated ...

First I need to create my own Solid Pod with the solidweb.org "interface".
Hopefully it was just a beta version, because the onboarding was very difficult.

The interface was so unfriendly, many minutes are needed to be familiar with it.
I was so desapointed by this interface, I have search for an alternative : inrupt.com
This company is the partener of Solid project and can host Pods. So I have created an account and I ... I cannot login into my account ...
The service was entering into an infinite loop ...

Seriously ! How a project like this can be so bad, I don't want to try Solid now :'(
The solution I've found is to login to Inrupt by importing my solidweb pod --' yeah, great ...

The solid technologie was started in 2017 and his twitter was wasn't update since 4 years, now I have just the bad impression that this project is dead.
